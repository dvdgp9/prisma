# Scratchpad: Add Delete Improvement Button

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to add a "delete improvement" button (eliminar mejora) next to the "edit" button. The icon to use is `xmark` from Iconoir.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Identify where the "edit improvement" button is located in the UI.
- Implement the "delete" functionality (API endpoint + UI button).
- Ensure the icon `xmark` from Iconoir is correctly used.
- Follow the Planner/Executor workflow.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Research**: Locate the "edit" button for "mejoras" in the codebase.
2. **Planning**: Define the API endpoint and the UI changes.
3. **Execution**: Implement the delete button and the backend logic.
4. **Verification**: Test the deletion.
